Introduction:
    This is what we call "Bamazon" is a "Amazon" type of online store that uses inputs with the command line using Node.js.

How to use Bamazon:
    You have two different views currently with a third in the works. 
        The first view you will look at is "bamazonCustomer.js", this is where the customer can order items from Bamazon. The second is "bamazonManager.js", this is where the manager can add new items for sale as well as restock items. The third, which is in development, would be the "bamazonSupervisor.js". The Supervisor will be able to look at each department's P&L's and add any new departments that may be needed.
